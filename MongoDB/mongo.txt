MongoDB- the word drived from Humongous(Meaning-Big size) 
MongoDB - It's a collection of documents(JSON) -(it can be stored as a BSON structure)

difference between MongoDB and Mysql 

Sql-should be maintain the data as structured (should follow schema- )
 The schema can not be changed. The inputs following the given schema are only entered.
each individual records are stored as ‘rows’ in a table.
*Normalization - Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table
Redundancy in DBMS is having several copies of the same data in the database.

NoSql - No forced schema and no normalization
each individual records are stored as ‘documents’. -It has a dynamic schema
nosql- 

optional - Suppose our data is stored in a another directory like (D, E). we have to set the path before run the MongoDB
(Shell) cmd -> mongod --dbpath="" (you have to enter the path in the " ")

console clear- cntrl+L

Next Line - Cntrl+enter

Cursor - 

db.employee.find({filter}, {projection}, {Query})

Query Operators 
        Comparision Operator
        Logical Operators
        Evaluation Operator

$regex uses “Perl Compatible Regular Expressions” (PCRE) as the matching engine.



Aggregation :

Aggregation is the process of selecting data from a collection to process multiple documents and returns computed results
  * group values from multiple documents together
  * Fetching a lot of nested data to perform complex Operations
  * Filter and sort documents and analyze data changes

Stages:
$match
$group
$sort
$project
